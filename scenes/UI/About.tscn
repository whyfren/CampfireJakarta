text = "He was the kind of person who never turned away from a lost chance — when a storm tossed his town’s savings chest off the pier, he jumped in without thinking. Every dive down into the cold blue was a small bet: hold your breath, find a coin, come up and breathe again. He kept the coins in an old tin and counted them by moonlight, because each coin meant food, a repaired roof, or one more day for someone who needed him. The sea tested him with currents and dark shapes, but he learned routes where the water calmed and the coins liked to hide. Sometimes he wondered if he was chasing money or chasing the feeling of being useful, but either way he could not stop — the ocean had taken something from him, and he wanted it back. On nights when the tide was gentle, he stared at the tin and thought about what he would do when it was full, but the answer always slipped like a fish between his fingers, leaving the ending open."
